###### CHICAGO

>Chicago is the most **populous city in the U.S**. state of Illinois, and the third most populous city in the United States, following New York City and Los Angeles. Located on the shores of freshwater Lake Michigan. Chicago is an international hub for finance, culture, commerce, industry, education, technology, telecommunications, and transportation. I like this place because it is **flexible to all who live here** and also with good atmosphere.
